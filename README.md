# Unification modulo AC

__Work in progress.__

This implementation of AC-unification depends heavily on a linear diophantine
equation solver. Currently I am finishing up a Scala implementation of Contejean
and Devie's algorithm for this purpose: https://github.com/ayberkt/linear-diophantine.

This work will eventually be integrated into the Scala backend of the K framework.
